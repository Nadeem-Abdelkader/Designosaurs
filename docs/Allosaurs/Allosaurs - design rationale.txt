For Allosaurs to be added into the game, a new dedicated class will be added into the game where it will interface the
classes similar to Stegosaur where it has the same behaviour such as eat, breed, wander and follow, however there will
be extra behaviour such as attack where an allosaur will attack a stegosaur. When creating the class allosaurs, it is
expected that a Stegosaur will inherite a dinosaur class but if there are no such classes the only way to implement
another type of dinosaur is to create another class for it.
