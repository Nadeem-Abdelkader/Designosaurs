For players to gain points or currency by doing certain objectives in the game, the player class will have two classes
to modify the current points the player has, which is gaining points or losing points, at the moment there is only
methods to gain points for the player by doing objectives in the game and no methods to lose points so a class to
decrement points from players might be redundant but if such  mechanism is being implemented in the future, such method
can be implemented into this game without requiring to refactor any existing code and such. The player class will
inherit the Actor class as shown in the engine sequence diagram.

For the vending machine to be implemented in the world, it will inherit the ground class from the engine and interface
two classes, GainItem and UseCurrency. The GainItem class is used for when the player spends the points and gains the
item that the player wants to exchange to, it is implemented as a class to allow easy addition of any new items or to
delete any existing items from the vending machine. The UseCurrency class will be used just to update the player's
current points when the player buys an item.
