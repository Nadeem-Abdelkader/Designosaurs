For Agilisaurus to be added into the game, a new dedicated class will be added into the game where it will interface the
classes similar to Stegosaur where it has the same behaviour such as eat, breed, wander and follow, however there will
be extra behaviour such as SeekCorpseBehaviour where an Agilisaurus will search for corpses to eat. Agilisaurus class extends the Dinosaur class.
