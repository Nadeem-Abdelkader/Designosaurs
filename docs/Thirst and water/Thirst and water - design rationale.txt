To implement thirst and water in the system new behaviours for seeking and drinking water should be added, so a SeekWaterBehaviour and a DrinkWaterBehaviour class was created.

The SeekWaterBehaviour class:
    1 - Implements the Behaviour class

The DrinkWaterBehaviour class:
    1 - Implements the Behaviour class

To implement a system that will allow Dinosaurs to drink, a Water class was created.

The Water class:
    1 - Extends the Ground class
    2 - Has a dependency relationship with the Application class (Application creates a Water instance)
